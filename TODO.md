## Install

-   [ ] Use zsh_unplugged instead of zplug
-   [ ] Create install options with local variants per machine
    -   E.g.:
    -   personal-macbook/zsh, tmux, vim...
    -   work-macbook/zsh, tmux, vim...

## Vim

-   [ ] Migrate entire config to lua
-   [ ] Create a Ctrl-P mapping that merges all the common fzf sources
-   [x] Merge lsp configs (same mappings) across personal and work
-   [x] Consider migrating from deoplete to nvim-cmp
